My open source contributions primarily revolve around Infrastructure/Platform as a Service deployment and automation.

The projects I most actively contribute to are:
- [openshift-restclient-python](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python) - A generated python client for OpenShift/kubernetes. Closely related to the kubernetes [client-python](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python) project.
- [home-cluster](https://github.com/fabianvf/home-cluster) - A project to handle the deployment of an OpenShift cluster targeted for normal home environments. This is what I use for my home openshift cluster and what I hope will act as the hub for my future home automation efforts.
- [openshift-ansible](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible) - The official installer for OpenShift.
- [ansible k8s](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/modules/k8s_module.html) - Ansible modules for interacting with the Kubernetes and OpenShift API.
- [ansible-service-broker](https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker) - An Open Service Broker that allows you to use containerized Ansible playbooks to deploy applications to OpenShift directly from the OpenShift UI.
- [python-rake](https://github.com/fabianvf/python-rake) - A Python implementation of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm as described in: Rose, S., Engel, D., Cramer, N., & Cowley, W. (2010). Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents. In M. W. Berry & J. Kogan (Eds.), Text Mining: Theory and Applications: John Wiley & Sons.

I also have contributed to a variety of open source projects, including [Foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman), [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), and [Ansible Container](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container)
