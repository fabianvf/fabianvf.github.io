My primary contributions include Elasticsearch integration for the
[Open Science Framework](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io), 
the flagship product of the Center for Open Science.

I also work on a data processing pipeline called [scrapi](https://github.com/fabianvf/scrapi), 
which serves as the core for the [SHARE notification service](http://share-research.org). 
The SHARE notification service is designed to record research release events from various open 
access repositories, and notify
interested parties with a normalized metadata document. Scrapi is the data processing
pipeline that handles aggregating all these research release events, normalizing them,
and shooting them out to various backends which users can query and subscribe to.
