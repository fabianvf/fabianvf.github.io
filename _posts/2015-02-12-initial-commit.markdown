So, I finally got around to making a little personal site. Please excuse
the temporary ugliness, I will get around to cleaning this up once I have
a little more free time. At the moment, I am prepping for a beta release
of the SHARE notification service, working on some fixes for the Cassandra
object mapper [cqlengine](https://github.com/cqlengine/cqlengine), and
handling a few feature additions to the Elasticsearch module in the
[Open Science Framework](osf.io).
