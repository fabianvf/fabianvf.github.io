I am a software developer living in Charlottesville, VA and working for
the [Center for Open Science](http://www.cos.io). I also mentor FIRST robotics team 3373,
where I teach high school students how to code in Python and Java.
My interests include functional programming, formal software verification, and natural language processing.
I'm most experienced with Python, but I have enjoyed hacking in Coq, Haskell, and lately Idris.

In my free time I like to read about cool new experimental languages with proof systems
like Idris, and hack on open source projects. I also enjoy abusing Python's flexibility
to integrate functional programming concepts into the language. I can frequently be found
hanging out with my fiancee and dog, and ingesting a never-ending stream of pop-culture and media.
