I am a software engineer working for Red Hat in Raleigh, NC. My work is focused on OpenShift/Kubernetes automation,
both deploying the platforms and deploying applications on top of them. I've also worked extensively on
Kubernetes-Ansible integration. I am currently contributing to the
[OpenShift Python client](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python), the
[Kubernetes and OpenShift Ansible modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/modules/k8s_module.html), the
[OpenShift installer](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible), and a 
variety of Golang projects focused around integration between Operators and Ansible. I have also been 
contributing most of my free time to a [home-centric OpenShift deployment](https://github.com/fabianvf/home-cluster), running
a containerized [Rook](https://rook.io) managed Ceph cluster for storage.

My interests include functional programming, formal software verification, and automation.
I'm most experienced with Python, Ruby, and Go, but I have enjoyed hacking in Coq, Haskell, and lately Idris.
I'm also intimately familiar with Ansible and have a love-hate relationship with Puppet.

In my free time I like to read about cool new experimental languages with proof systems
like Idris, and hack on open source projects. I also enjoy abusing Python's flexibility
to integrate functional programming concepts into the language. I can usually be found
hanging out with my wife and dogs, playing board games, or practicing my freestyles in Rocket League.
