I am a software developer living in Charlottesville, VA and working for
the [Center for Open Science](http://www.cos.io). I also mentor FIRST robotics team 3373,
where I teach high school students how to code in Python and Java.
My interests include robotics, databases, search engines,
formal software verification, and natural language processing.

The [Center for Open Science](http://www.cos.io) is a nonprofit start up devoted
to promoting openness, integrity, and reproducibility in science.
We build free and open source software to streamline scientist workflow,
while at the same time making it easier for scientists to share their
research materials and data.
