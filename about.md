I am a software engineer working for Red Hat in Raleigh, NC. My work is focused on OpenShift/Kubernetes automation,
both deploying the platforms and deploying applications on top of them. I am currently contributing to the 
[openshift-ansible](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible) installer, the [openshift python client](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python),
the [kubernetes and openshift ansible modules](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-kubernetes-modules), and
the [ansible-service-broker](https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker).

My interests include functional programming, formal software verification, and automation.
I'm most experienced with Python, Ruby, and Go, but I have enjoyed hacking in Coq, Haskell, and lately Idris.
I'm also intimately familiar with Ansible and have a love-hate relationship with Puppet.

In my free time I like to read about cool new experimental languages with proof systems
like Idris, and hack on open source projects. I also enjoy abusing Python's flexibility
to integrate functional programming concepts into the language. I can usually be found
hanging out with my wife and dogs, playing board games, or practicing my freestyles in Rocket League.

Recently I've been focusing on home infrastructure for IoT/automation. I mostly am focusing on deploying
and configuring a private cloud so that I can participate in the IoT ecosystem my life being sold to
advertisers.
